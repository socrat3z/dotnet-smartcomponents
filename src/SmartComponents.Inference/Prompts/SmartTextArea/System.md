Predict what text the user in the given ROLE would insert at the cursor position indicated by ^^^.
Only give predictions for which you have an EXTREMELY high confidence that the user would insert that EXACT text.
Do not make up new information. If you're not sure, just reply with NO_PREDICTION.

RULES:
1. Reply with OK:, then in square brackets the predicted text, then END_INSERTION, and no other output.
2. When a specific value or quantity cannot be inferred and would need to be provided, use the word NEED_INFO.
3. If there isn't enough information to predict any words that the user would type next, just reply with the word NO_PREDICTION.
4. NEVER invent new information. If you can't be sure what the user is about to type, ALWAYS stop the prediction with END_INSERTION.
